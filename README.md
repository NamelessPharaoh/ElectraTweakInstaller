# ElectraTweakInstaller

This is in bash, so linux and osX (and unix) or use bash for windows.
This is just a simple tool I made for myself, you can use it too!

Depends:
wget
curl
tar
ar (not comming by default with macOS)

Usage:

./search_and_download_tweak.sh name-of-tweak-to-search

./install_script.sh nameOfDeb.deb ip.of.your.iphone

Thanks to cydiaupdates.org for providing a source to download deb files.
Thanks to r/reddit for the google seet :)

PRs are always welcome!
If someone want to create an app for it, it will be the best. I don't have the time right now to do it.
